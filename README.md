# Spaceship Two-Step Sequential Learning Task
This is an adaptation of Nathaniel Daw's two-step decision making task.
Original code and stimuli were generously shared by Dr. Arkady Konovalov and Dr. Catherine Hartley.

This version of the task uses spaceships/aliens stimuli and is designed for kids.
I have made a number of major changes for the purposes of my work:

For this version of the task:
 - I overhauled the tutorial to ensure that participants could understand the rules and complex dynamics of the game. The new design is based on prior qualitative testing of the task tutorial, as well as feedback from multiple clinical psychologists that specialize in cognitive development.

- I created higher quality stimuli and expanded the stimuli set. This was done so that each block (practice and main game) had entirely different stimuli and the stimuli colors/shapes could be randomized between subjects.

- There are practice rounds and one block of 150 trials. In the block of 150 trials, participants attempt to win space treasure. After each trial in which they win space treasure, they are able to "trade" their space treasure for tickets or food. Tickets are accumulated and used to purchase a prize at the end of the study. If participants trade their space treasure for food, participants get one "bite" (e.g. 1 M&M, 1 CheezIt) of food immediately.
